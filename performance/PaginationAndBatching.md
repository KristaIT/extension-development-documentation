# Pagination and batching

## Overview

Pagination prevents large responses from overwhelming your extension or upstream APIs. Batching reduces repeated calls when you need to fetch or update many objects.

## Pagination

Recommendations:

1. Always cap page size to a safe maximum.
2. Return paging metadata (cursor/next token, total count if available).
3. Treat paging tokens as opaque.

## Batching

Batch when:

- the external API supports bulk operations
- your workflow naturally processes lists

Batching guidance:

- limit batch sizes (avoid large payloads)
- handle partial failures (report which items failed)
- keep operations idempotent if retries may happen
