# Observability

## Overview

Operational visibility is what makes an extension supportable in production. Aim to make failures diagnosable without debugging sessions by emitting consistent logs and telemetry.

## What to observe

At minimum, capture:

1. **Which request ran** (catalog request name + type)
2. **Which invoker ran it** (invoker identifier / environment label where available)
3. **Which external operation was called** (endpoint/method or action name)
4. **Latency** (total and upstream)
5. **Outcome** (success, input error, auth error, upstream error)
6. **Retry behavior** (attempt count, backoff)

## Logging guidance

### Do

- log at the controller boundary (request start/end)
- log upstream status codes and correlation IDs when safe
- include stable identifiers (invoker id, request name)

### Do not

- log secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- log entire attribute maps
- log full upstream payloads by default

## Telemetry (metrics/tracing)

Recommended metrics:

- request count by request name/type
- request duration histogram
- external call duration histogram
- error count by category
- retry count

Tracing guidance:

- create spans around upstream calls
- propagate correlation IDs if the external API supports them

## Operational dashboards (suggested)

1. Error rate by catalog request
2. P95/P99 latency by catalog request
3. Rate limit and timeout counts
4. Token refresh failures (if applicable)
